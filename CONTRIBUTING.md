# Contributing

## Have you found a bug?

Great! Please open an Issue and I'll try to look at it as soon as I can.

## Want to add a new feature?

First of all, thank you! All you need to do is fork, make a branch, then open a PR and
I'll try to review it when I'm available.

## Things to leave to me

### Bugzilla

I ask that you leave https://bugs.gentoo.org integration to me so I can 
gain the experience of learning bugzilla's API myself, you can open a PR for it
but if I have the time to work on it I likely won't merge it.

I appreciate you taking the time to implement it but learning the API of 
it has been an interest of mine for a while now.
