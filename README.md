# Todo

A simple todo app written in Python for the CLI

I made this because I got sick of keeping track of my todo stuff in a markdown 
file.

## Installing

1. Copy `./todo` to a place in PATH
2. Enjoy!

# Todo for todo

- [ ] Add ability to edit entries
- [ ] Search ability (for those that have an infinitely growing todo list)
- [ ] Refactor/rewrite in other language? 
  - Not sure how wise or doable this would be. Current candidates are Rust, Go, or Racket.
  - If refactor, using the Click library maybe? I'd rather keep dependencies to a minimum though
